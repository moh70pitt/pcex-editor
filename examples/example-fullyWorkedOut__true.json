We also have a 7x3 matrix that stores the number of medals that these seven countries won. This matrix looks like as follows:\\n{ {1, 0, 1 },\\n { 1, 1, 0 },\\n ...}\\nThe first, second, and third numbers within a row i represent the number of Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals won by the country that is at the index i of the array of countries.\\nConstruct a program that takes this matrix and the array of countries, and prints a table of medal counts with row total that shows the number of Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Total medals for each of the countries that participated in the competition. The output table should look like as follows:\\n    Country    Gold  Silver  Bronze   Total\\n     Canada        1       0       1            2\\n        China        1       1       0            2\\n       ...\\n",
